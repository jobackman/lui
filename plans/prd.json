    "details": "Add transform: scale() CSS transitions to images in export-card.tsx and addon-detail-page.tsx. Use Tailwind's hover:scale-105 or hover:scale-110 for subtle zoom effect. Duration: ~300-500ms with ease-out timing to match existing transitions. Respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility. Ensure zoom doesn't interfere with existing carousel auto-pause functionality. Apply overflow-hidden to parent containers to prevent zoomed images from breaking layout.",
